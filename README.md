**What is this project about?**

It's intended as a Pokedex implementation to help me learn the basics of JavaScript and Web-Development.

**How to get it running for yourself?**

Clone this repositorie and then open the index.html in any somewhat modern browser. It should work right out of the box!

**What technology is used?**

HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. There is a part about using node.js too together with a Cronjob, but the project is in a state where it doesn't need it, but the integration should be relatively easy if so desired.

**What API is used?**

The project relies on the pokeapi.co/v2, especially the pokemon and pokemon-species endpoints. You can find the documentation of the API here: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2
